% takes data in X where each column is one variable and generates matrix X,
% where each column contains a quadratic term of the variables in X - this
% is different from a Kronecker product because there is no redundancy

% INPUT
% X     N-by-w data matrix where N is number of data points, w is number of
%       variables

% OUTPUT
% X2    N-by-(w*(w+1)/2) matrix of quadratic terms of data in X
