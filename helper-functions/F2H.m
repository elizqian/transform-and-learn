% converts F matrix operator which operates on get_x_sq output (no
% Kronecker redundancy) to tensorized matrix operator H which operates on
% kron(x,x) output (with redundancy)

% INPUT
% F     w-by-(w*(w+1)/2) matrix operator that acts on get_x_sq.m output,

% OUTPUT
% H     w-by-w^2 tensorized matrix operator that acts on kron(x,x)
